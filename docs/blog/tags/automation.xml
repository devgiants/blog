            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="home-automation">Home automation</h2>

<p>On my previous attempts on DIY home automation, I used the excellent <a href="https://www.openhab.org/">openHAB</a>.
At first glance, it seemed to have everything I looked for in an home automation context :
- Completely open-source
- <strong>Technology and vendor agnostic</strong> : one of the most important thing, I didn't want to rely on proprietary technology to build this system. Everything has to be transparent from ground to roof, and modifiable to ensure long-term usage and adaptation
- <strong>Ability to program for serious work</strong> : it's utterly important to me that real programmation feature would be available. Way I do things doesn't match with a click-land configuration job. Using <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend</a> (because openHAB written in Java), it allows to create programs to drive your installation.</p>

<p>So why change? Some cons :
- I realized after usage that all the stuff embedded (item branching with technologies, configuration...) simply wasn't for me
- Xtend implementation in this usage, though really neat, does not allow things I wanted (such as script reuse accross handlers...)
- All the Java stuff creates pressure on underlying hardware, thus forcing to have something powerful (old Raspberry Pis was not so good)</p>

<p>Don't misunderstand me : OpenHAB is great job used y thousand of people accross the world. I just needed something else.</p>

<h2 id="domofony">Domofony</h2>

<p><em>Domotique</em> + <em>Symfony</em> = <a href="https://github.com/devgiants/domofony"><strong>Domofony</strong></a>.</p>

<p><em>Domotique</em> is the french word for home automation. First thing to know, I created this project for myself, and share it a good practice, but at start, not all things will be usable by everyone (such as the front-end app I plan to develop tailored to my use).</p>

<p><strong>This is a solution provided by a developer for developers</strong>. Exit click-land, all configuration is done in YAML.</p>

<h3 id="technical-components">Technical components</h3>

<p><img src="https://devgiants.fr/images/posts/domofony/technical_components.png" alt="Technical components" /></p>

<p>All part showed on above layout will be described and detailed in future posts. That being said, below is a quick description for bigger parts.</p>

<h4 id="front-end-application">Front-end application</h4>

<p>This is the application allowing user to interact with the system. It will consume REST API exposed by the server application.</p>

<h4 id="mosquitto-broker">Mosquitto broker</h4>

<p>The system relies so far on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT protocol</a> 
(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mqtt-un-protocole-bas%C3%A9-sur-tcp-et-orient%C3%A9-iot-nicolas-bonniot/">here</a> a protocol tour in french) for exchanges between <strong>central system</strong> and <strong>items</strong>.
This protocol is ideal regarding it's asynchronous sequence and its lightweight. 
Security is not left aside, although TLS certificate usage means items must be more powerful than simple microcontrollers.</p>

<p><em>Note : an item is the end-device, such as sensor or actuator (or both). In my home automation system, this is mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">SBC</a> or ESP series microcontrollers</em></p>

<p>Future posts will handle in details <strong>items</strong>, <strong>Symfony application</strong>, <strong>Mosquitto broker &amp; client configuration</strong> and <strong>front-end application</strong>.</p>
